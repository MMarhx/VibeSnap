# VibeSnap

Generate prototypes anywhere. Validate them here.

Paste single-file HTML prototypes (with inline CSS + JS),
run them safely in a sandbox, and collect lightweight feedback
without setup, accounts, or tracking.

## Philosophy
- Local-first
- Privacy-respecting
- Validation over polish
- No analytics creep

## Status
Early prototype. UX and backend coming next.

## How it works

1. Paste a single-file HTML prototype
2. Preview it instantly in a sandboxed environment
3. Share a link for quick feedback

No accounts. No setup. No tracking.
