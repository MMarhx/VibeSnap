# VibeSnap

Generate prototypes anywhere. Validate them here.

Paste single-file HTML prototypes (with inline CSS + JS),
run them safely in a sandbox,
and collect lightweight feedback — without setup, accounts, or tracking.

## Philosophy
- Local-first
- Privacy-respecting
- Validation over polish
- No analytics creep

## Status
This is an early prototype focused on fast validation and usability. Backend, sharing infrastructure, and deeper iteration will follow based on real user feedback.

## How it works
1. Paste a single-file HTML prototype (with inline CSS + JS)
2. Preview it instantly in a sandboxed environment
3. Share a link to collect quick feedback

No accounts. No setup. No tracking.

## Who this is for
VibeSnap is designed for:
- Product designers validating ideas quickly
- Founders testing concepts without full builds
- Developers sharing UI prototypes for feedback
- Anyone who wants fast signal without setup friction

## What’s next
- Refine UX and feedback flow
- Add lightweight sharing controls
- Explore optional backend features (without compromising privacy)
